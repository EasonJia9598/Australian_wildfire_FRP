This is a Data science initial project for me to first try using models on real-world tasks instead of theoretical learning.

In this jupyter notebook, we first analyze how to do data understanding, data preparation and data cleaning on a nasty dataset.

Then we set up a baseline model with random forest to predict the Fire radiative power of Australia's world Fire.

After that, we set our candidate model with a simple MLP.
