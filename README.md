In this jupyter notebook, we first analyze how to do data understanding, data preparation and data cleaning on a nasty dataset.

Then we set up a baseline model with random forest to predict the Fire radiative power of Australia's world Fire.

After that, we set our candidate model with a simple MLP. 

In the end, we compare those two models with a significance test to figure out the performance difference between them.
